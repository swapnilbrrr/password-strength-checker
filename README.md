# Password Strength Checker & Security Dashboard

This project is a web-based tool for assessing password strength in real-time. It provides immediate feedback to users based on a configurable security policy and visualizes password attempt data on a simple dashboard.

## SOC & GRC Relevance

This project demonstrates skills directly relevant to **Security Operations Center (SOC)** and **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** roles:

-   **Risk Assessment:** Identifies weak or vulnerable passwords to mitigate security risks.
-   **Policy Enforcement:** Validates passwords against a defined set of security rules, ensuring compliance.
-   **Monitoring & Reporting:** Logs password attempts and visualizes trends, providing insights for security monitoring.
-   **Governance Awareness:** Translates abstract security policies into actionable, easy-to-understand feedback for end-users.
-   **Practical Security Skills:** The tool's functionality aligns with real-world SOC workflows and GRC principles for managing user-related risk.
